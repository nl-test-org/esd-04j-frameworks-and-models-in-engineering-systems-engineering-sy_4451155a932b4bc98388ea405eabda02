"Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems." _Technology Review_ 73, no. 3 (1971): 52-68. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} One of our goals in ESD.04J / 1.041J is to teach you about systems thinking. To do so, we will introduce the ideas of some of the "Giants" of the systems field. You already have been introduced to the work of Churchman in the first reading. In this reading, we introduce you to some of the thinking of Professor Jay Forrester of MIT. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

"[Speech by NASA Administrator Michael Griffin: System Engineering and the Two Cultures of Engineering](http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=23775)." {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Peter Drucker is arguably the inventor of modern management. He has been writing on this subject since the 50s in a highly prolific and clear manner. He has his fans (including me) and his detractors ("it's all really obvious"). In a subject like this one, in which the management of your own talents, those of your group members and those on other groups, will be central to your overall success, we thought you should be exposed to Drucker's thinking. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} While this kind of article is never "on the test", there are some very valuable lessons contained therein. Why don't you take a half-hour and read it? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}
